	<span>Feedback:</span>
	<p>
			It looks like you are designing your application appropriately. I would have like to have seen more 

		detail e.g. what will the cards in the detail page contain, how will you show the events, how will you 

		show latest results etc.

		I&#39;m sure your website will be well designed but I don&#39;t really have enough content to comment much 

		more.

		I&#39;m impressed with your idea to show visual charts and look forward to seeing your site in more 

		detail.

	<p>I have implemented application against the provisional designs. The screen of the application is divided into three parts: side menu, main content and collapsible panel where details are shown. The cards mentioned in the feedback are displayed in the main container depending on the user action. The content of the carsd is dynamically pulled from the database using AJAX and appended to the document using jQuery. Clicking on the card will show specific information in detail on the collapsible part. </p>
