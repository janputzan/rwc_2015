Assessment – RIA Project – 50% overall weighting

Scenario

This year, 2015, will see a considerable number of major events unfold, for 

example:

• Festival e.g. T in the park

• Sport e.g. Golf

• Cultural e.g. the Chelsea flower show

• Theatre e.g. Cirque de Soleil

• Celebrity e.g. BBC sports personality of the year

The public appetite for up to date interactive information regarding these events is 

considerable.

Your task is to develop an innovative RIA to present information related to an 

events web site, showing information for a range of different event types. 

The project work requirements for the RIA are given on page 3.

Submission Details 

Submit work on the 27th April.

You should include with your work a tutor page containing an outline of your tutor 

feedback from week 7 and the actions you took in your project work in response to 

this feedback. 

Submit the project files in a zipped folder and the word document containing your 

written work separately via Blackboard. You should also host your project files on 

the Mayar server as follows:

mayar.abertay.ac.uk/~username/ria

There will be a tutor marked presentation of your after the submission of your 

work for which you will be allocated a time in due course.

Requirements for the RIA

General

The web application should have a professional look with the following 

characteristics:

• Attractive layout, colour and use of images

• Good contrast between background and text

• Clear functionality from the users perspective

• Purposeful interactive elements which enhances the appearance and 

functionality of the RIA

The web application should not have large areas of empty space or oversized 

graphics. 

Specific

The web application should be interactive on the client side with the following 

functionality:

• A clear use of HTML with jQuery together with any related JavaScript

• View of information including images in a master detail arrangement.

• The interface should make use of at least one each from: events, effects 

and widgets

• A jQuery AJAX load of dynamically changing information

• A jQuery plugin which organises an aspect of your site such as the CSS which 

you yourself have written rather than copied from a source.

• Another substantial and innovative feature which you have investigated 

yourself 

All of these features should be devised to further the interactivity of the site. The 

web application should not have pointless use of interactivity e.g. mouseover logo 

to show a larger logo. Pointless or trivial features will not receive full credit.

You may make use of code from other web sites including plugins but this should be 

referenced in a tutor page linked from the home page. You may also make use of 

content material from other sites but this should also be referenced.
